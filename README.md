## 📘 Overview

This project predicts the **likelihood of wildfire occurrence** using weather and environmental features from the **UCI Forest Fires Dataset**. The solution includes:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- A **Flask Web App** that allows users to input weather parameters and receive fire risk predictions

## 📊 Jupyter Notebook Highlights (`Final-Project-USD-AAI-510-GROUP-9.ipynb`)

### 1. 📌 Problem Statement
Build a model that predicts wildfire risk using weather-related data to support early warning systems and resource allocation.

### 2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Converted the `area` field into binary `fire` (1 = fire occurred, 0 = no fire)
- Visualized class distribution and continuous feature distributions

### 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Focused only on 8 numeric features for deployment simplicity:
  - `FFMC`, `DMC`, `DC`, `ISI`, `temp`, `RH`, `wind`, `rain`
- Removed categorical and geographic features for UI compatibility

### 4. 🧠 Model Building
- Used `RandomForestClassifier`
- Train-test split with stratification
- Evaluated using AUC, precision, recall, accuracy
- Saved model using `joblib` as `wildfire_model.pkl`

## 🌐 Flask Web App

A lightweight web interface built with Flask that lets users enter weather features and receive wildfire risk prediction.

### 🔧 Features
- Clean UI built with HTML + CSS
- Takes 8 weather parameters as input
- Displays prediction: 🔥 High Risk or ✅ Low Risk
- Local deployment for demo purposes

## 🚀 How to Use

### 📦 Step 1: Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Step 2: Run the Flask Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

### ▶️ Step 3: Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 🌐 Step 4: Open in Browser

For the Flask app, visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
The Streamlit app typically opens automatically at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
